/**
 * Templates - Page layouts
 * 
 * Page-level structures that define layout and placement of organisms.
 * Usually not included in design systems (more application-specific).
 * Examples: DashboardLayout, ArticleLayout, SettingsLayout
 * 
 * Note: Templates are rarely needed in a design system library.
 * They are more commonly created in the consuming applications.
